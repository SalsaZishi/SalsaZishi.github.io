To push myself to understand Computer Architecture, I will use this website
to pretend that I am teaching the course. I have been mooching off other 
people's notes and hard work for 20 years. Now it's only fair that I give back.

Hopefully, this site will elucidate Computer Architecture concepts for other
students in Computer Science, and allow me to learn about web development
using Jekyll.
